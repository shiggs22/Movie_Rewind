			<h2>Movie of the Month: Dumb and Dumber</h2>
					<p>In light of the now in progress movie Dumb and Dumber Too,
					staring Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas and Jeff Daniels as 
					Harry Dunne. The duo are back and we can't be more excited! Since
					the first movie came out back in 1994 we the people were waiting
					to see and hoping for the two to come back together for another take 
					on the Dumb and Dumber franchise. We were let down when the movie Dumb
					and Dumberer came out; it just seemed to be a slap in the faces of the
					people who loved the first movie. The take on the this prequel When
					Harry meet Lloyd was such an <strong>awful</strong> movie that most 
					people couldn't watch it for more than 30 minutes! We understand that
					Harry and Lloyd are "dumb" but come on, this was just down right 
					stupid of a movie.So after that massive fail, we all wanted Jim Carrey
					and Jeff Daniels back together, on the big screen, playing the 
					characters once again so we can get a laugh that we all remembered 
					from the past.So, the Farelly Brothers answered our prayers and got 
					the team together to make a true second movie to the late Dumb and 
					Dumber!</p>
