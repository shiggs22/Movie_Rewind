			<h2>Movie of the Month: Dumb and Dumber</h2>
					<p>In light of the now in progress movie Dumb and Dumber Too,
					staring Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas and Jeff Daniels as 
					Harry Dunne. The duo are back and we can't be more excited! Since
					the first movie came out back in 1994 we the people were waiting
					to see and hoping for the two to come back together for another take 
					on the Dumb and Dumber franchise. We were let down when the movie Dumb
					and Dumberer came out; it just seemed to be a slap in the faces of the
					people who loved the first movie. The take on the this prequel When
					Harry meet Lloyd was such an <strong>awful</strong> movie that most 
					people couldn't watch it for more than 30 minutes! We understand that
					Harry and Lloyd are "dumb" but come on, this was just down right 
					stupid of a movie.So after that massive fail, we all wanted Jim Carrey
					and Jeff Daniels back together, on the big screen, playing the 
					characters once again so we can get a laugh that we all remembered 
					from the past.So, the Farelly Brothers answered our prayers and got 
					the team together to make a true second movie to the late Dumb and 
					Dumber!</p>

					<h2>Review</h2>
						
						<p>The Farrelly brothers have made a name for themselves creating 
						comedy out of some of the most over-the-top, absurdly amusing 
						antics of people who don't normally get the limelight. These 
						include stalkers, idiots, the handicapped, the obese, and even 
						Siamese twins. For the directing team, the more "out there" the 
						better. "Dumb and Dumber" put them on the comedy map, and while 
						the movie isn't a work of genius, it remains one of their best 
						and a very funny film. There's just something about the sheer 
						zaniness of the film that works as plain dumb fun. The story 
						follows the exploits of Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd 
						(Jim Carrey), who work as a dog-groomer and limo driver, 
						respectively. One particular day, a beautiful redhead named Mary 
						(Lauren Holly) leaves a briefcase full of money in the backseat 
						of Lloyd's limo. Being that Lloyd is completely smitten with 
						Mary, he takes it upon himself and his fellow moronic chum to find
						Mary and return the case to her. Little do the ditzy duo realize
						that the case is full of ransom money Mary was leaving behind 
						for a pair thugs, who work for the man who has kidnapped Mary's 
						husband. Still, nothing can stop Harry and Lloyd from hopping 
						in Harry's dog-costumed car and trekking cross country to Aspen
						to return the case. Along the way the pair encounter a myriad 
						of obstacles that might keep them from their goal. One of the 
						most entertaining of these segments is their encounter with a 
						trucker named Sea Bass (Cam Neely), who terrorizes them at a 
						diner stop. The thugs (played by Mike Starr and Karen Duffy) 
						also provide an amusing set of obstacles as they mistake Harry 
						and Lloyd for a couple of genius assassins hired by Mary's 
						family to send the kidnappers a message. Not even traveling 
						the final leg of their journey aboard a kid-sized scooter 
						prevents them from returning the money to Mary. After all, 
						she is the love of Lloyd's life. The film belongs to Carrey 
						and Daniels the whole way. Together they present a sort of 
						manic hilarity that, while at times feeling overwhelming, 
						is a great comedic pairing. The Carrey we have here is the one 
						well before he turned to drama. Here he displays a zany, 
						physical presence that he was most known for (this was the guy 
						who excelled at talking out of his butt). Daniels also has many
						moments that work as an excellent foil for Carey's antics. 
						Daniels' Harry is much more subdued than Lloyd, and Daniels 
						gives him an underlying sense of sincerity that would be 
						otherwise squashed, and he holds his own against Carrey with 
						the broad comedy.</p>
